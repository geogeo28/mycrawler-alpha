Components :
------------

X Add a level MemoryTrace into the logger.
X Add memory manager to tracking memory leaks.
X Create a testing module. See QTest library.
X Bug : Cannot show a message box in the logger CLoggerMsgBox from a thread without GUI widget.
X (thread-unsafe controlled, see notes) Remove the pointer 'm_pClient' and the method 'clientPeer()' in the class MCClientThread because it's thread-unsafe.
X (the slot must be protected but not signals emitted) Avoid to use a mutex in the slots of MCClientThread.
X Improve ServerLogWidget. See CTRL + A behavior. Copy one or more lines of the log must be possible. Add a context menu.
X Bug (Major) : When a computer plays the role of server with an Internet connection and another computer with the same Internet connection
plays the role of client, the server sees the client authenticating and disconnected states with the error 'The remote host closed the
connection' three times. In the client, after  the state connected and 15 seconds, the error 'The remote host closed the connection'
occured too. Bug not observed with a Freebox.
(2009-04-27 Rev 41) - Reorganize the src folder with packages (with .pri or .pro files).
(2009-04-27 Rev 41) - Add a base exception named Exception with upper exceptions such as CAssertException, CBadAddressException...
(2009-04-27 Rev 41) - Add the CLoggerConsole inherited of ILogger to log messages into a console.
(2009-04-27 Rev 41) - ILogger instance shared with different logger with different levels in order to register logs with ILogger::instance().
               MemoryTrace => memory.log
               NoticeAll => stdout and mycrawler.log
(2009-04-28 Rev 49) - Add a level Trace into the logger.
(2009-04-29 Rev 53) - Add settings capability. See QSettings class.
(2009-05-06 Rev 71) - Bug : When an exception occured no message box is shown even if a widget has been created.
(2009-05-18 Rev 121) - Added a new type of exception (CFileException).
(2009-05-19 Rev 126) - The settings must be load and saved in IApplication instances (MCServerApplication and MCClientApplication).
(2009-05-19 Rev 128) - Add the code for the button 'Default values' in the dialog preferences.
(2009-05-21 Rev 134) - Send an error message to the host if the method 'refuseConnection()' is call in the class MCClientPeer.
(2009-05-27 Rev 146) - Manage a ConnectionRefused packet before received an handshake.
(2009-05-28 Rev 149) - The class MCServerInfo must be thread-safe.
- Derived QTreeWidgetItem with a own class in order to improve columns sorting.
- Bug : The error 'Connection refused' is never processed because the connection is closed just after the message was emitted.
- Don't emit the signal 'disconnected' when the connection is refused by the server or the client wasn't authenticated.
- MCClientPeer : Split requests and responses in two categories. Added a RequestTimeoutTimer and check if the data to read is the reponse to a specific request.
- MCClientPeer : Added PendingRequestTimeout.
- Avoid tables of QTreeWidgetItem* in TreeWidgets. Prefer to use a backtracker (QObject dynamic property).


MyCrawlerServer :
-----------------
X The class MCServer must be thread-safe. Added Read/Write mutex. Keep an eye on this singleton.
(2009-05-17 Rev 112) - Detect multi connections with the same MAC address (remote client).
(2009-05-17 Rev 117) - Improve the management of the mutex in the class MCClientThread.
(2009-05-19 Rev 126) - Use a setting in the Preferences Dialog for save/or not the server history.
(2009-05-21 Rev 132) - Clean-up the code in MCClientsTreeWidgets (factorize the code).
(2009-05-28 Rev 149) - Bug : The peer address of a client is not showed after load the server history.
- Bug : Column' state of the Tree Widget MCClientsTreeWidget is lost when another form is selected and the application is closed.


MyCrawlerClient :
-----------------
X Store MCServerInfo in each item of MCServersTreeWidget.
(2009-05-26 Rev 144) - Load the proxy settings before call the method 'connectToHost' of MCClient.
(2009-05-26 Rev 144) - Add an enumerate type 'Connection states' in MCClient (Connecting even during authenticating...).
